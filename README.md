Hello, 
my name is Igor Mytsik. Welcome to my github portfolio.

Programming languages that I use: Python, C/C++.

My skill range includes: 
  1. OpenGL graphics. I've developed several OpenGL projects (Core version 3.3) using C++ language. For one of them I have developed shader class to make work with them more straightforward and efficient.
  2. MySQL. Program that reads browser's sqlite databases and shows user's search history, downloads and bookmarks.
  3. Socket programming. Unix based DNS resolution program.
