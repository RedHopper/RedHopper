Hello, 
my name is Igor Mytsik. This online portfolio has been made made with purpose to demonstrate my programming skills.

I specialize in Data analysis, Game development, Networking and Software engineering.

My main programming language is Python. My secondary languages are: C/C++. 
I use them when best perfomance is the goal. For example when making a game with specific 
perfomace target, which can't be achieved with other popular game engines. In this my main tool is OpenGL.
I code in C# to make games on Unity game engine.
I have experience in SQL, pandas, numpy.
