Hello, 
my name is Igor Mytsik. This online portfolio has been made made with purpose to demonstrate my programming skills.

My main programming language is Python. My secondary languages are: C/C++. 
I use C/C++ when best perfomance is the goal. For example when making a game with specific 
perfomace target, which can't be achieved with other popular game engines. In this case I use OpenGL.
I use C# to make games on Unity game engine.
